# ClothHive

ClothHive is a fashion e-commerce web app built with ReactJS and Symfony. The project is in its early stages and only the home page code has been uploaded to the GitHub repository. The page has a responsive design, a clean layout, and high-quality images. I will work on implementing user accounts, search and filter items, add items to a shopping cart, and process payments. The goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for fashion enthusiasts.
